                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>Our team is developing a new educational video game aimed at 
                    students from 4th to 8th grade. This project focuses on combining fun 
                    gameplay with educational content aligned with the Massachusetts Department 
                    of Education and Common Core standards. The game will be carefully tailored 
                    to suit the varying reading, motor, and analytical skills of our young 
                    audience, offering an engaging learning experience.</p>

                <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>"PEMDAS Prison" is an educational Roblox game designed to aid 5th and 6th graders in learning single-variable equations aligned with Common Core standards. Set in a virtual prison, players solve math problems to navigate through the facility, avoid guards, and strategically interact with various objects. The game emphasizes learning order of operations through engaging challenges, offering different difficulty levels to cater to varying skills. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document comprehensively outlines the game's functional and non-functional aspects, serving as a blueprint for development.</p>
